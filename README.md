# Smart_Irrigation

IOT is changing the way we live. IOT is also changing the way trees and plants live!
This project helps you understand how to implement IOT in very important areas like agriculture and irrigation.
What if we can give exactly the right amount of water at exactly the right time?
Learn real skills by building this project.
you will work with a soil moisture sensor, ESP-8266 WiFi module and an Arduino board to develop a smart irrigation system project. The device can detect the change in moisture level in the soil and controls the flow of water accordingly with a DC pump. You will also program the system to send data to the cloud platform for storage and analysis. 
By building this project you will learn about:

IoT - Concepts & Applications
Arduino Architecture & Programming
Calibration of Sensors
Virtuino App development
